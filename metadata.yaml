description: This 1921 play, subtitled A Comedy in One Act, is Cabell's only published
  play script. The drama is based on the short story Balthazar's Daughter that originally
  appeared in Cabell's 1916 collection, The Certain Hour . In his prologue, the author
  confesses that the play lacks moral fervor and hopes it will corrupt no reader irretrievably.
